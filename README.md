**Warning** — We strongly recommend that you run the program within Docker (see below), since some commands might alter your system. 
    For example, some actions modify files and directories below /bin, /etc, /dev, etc.
    Make sure you fully understand what is the purpose of this tool before running any action.

## Usage

The full command line documentation is [here](./docs/event-generator.md).

### List actions

```shell
$ event-generator list

helper.ExecLs
helper.NetworkActivity
helper.RunShell
k8saudit.ConfigmapPrivateCreds
k8saudit.DisallowedPodDeployment
k8saudit.HostnetworkDeployment
k8saudit.NodeportService
k8saudit.PrivilegedDeployment
k8saudit.RolePodExec
k8saudit.RoleWildcardResources
k8saudit.RoleWritePrivileges
k8saudit.SensitiveMountDeployment
k8saudit.VanillaConfigmap
k8saudit.VanillaDeployment
k8saudit.VanillaRoleRolebindingServiceaccount
k8saudit.VanillaService
syscall.ChangeThreadNamespace
syscall.CreateFilesBelowDev
syscall.DbProgramSpawnProcess
syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs
syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs
syscall.NonSudoSetuid
syscall.ReadSensitiveFile
syscall.ReadSensitiveFileAfterStartup
syscall.RunShellUntrusted
syscall.ScheduleCronJobs
syscall.SystemProcsNetworkActivity
syscall.SystemUserInteractive
syscall.UserMgmtBinaries
syscall.WriteBelowBinaryDir
syscall.WriteBelowEtc
syscall.WriteBelowRpmDatabase
```

### Run actions
```
event-generator run [regexp]
```
Without arguments it runs all actions, otherwise only those actions matching the given regular expression.

For example, to run `syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs` and
`syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs` actions only:
```shell
$ sudo event-generator run syscall\.\*BinaryDirs

INFO sleep for 1s                                  action=syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs
INFO writing to /bin/directory-created-by-event-generator  action=syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs
INFO sleep for 1s                                  action=syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs
INFO modifying /bin/true to /bin/true.event-generator and back  action=syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs
```

Useful options:
- `--loop` to run actions in a loop
- `--sleep` to set the length of time to wait before running an action (default to `1s`)

All other options are documented [here](./docs/event-generator_run.md).


### With Docker

Run all events with the Docker image locally:

```shell
docker run -it --rm falcosecurity/event-generator run
```


### With Kubernetes


Run the following command to create the Service Account (`falco-event-generator`), Cluster Role, and Role that will allow the tool to create objects in the current namespace:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment/role-rolebinding-serviceaccount.yaml
```

Run all events once using a Kubernetes job:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment/run-as-job.yaml
```

Run all events in a loop using a Kubernetes deployment:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/event-generator.yaml
```

**N.B.**
The above commands apply to the `default` namespace. Use the `--namespace` option to use a different namespace. Events will be generated in the same namespace.

## Collections

### Generate System Call activity
The `syscall` collection performs a variety of suspect actions that are detected by the [default Falco ruleset](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/rules/falco_rules.yaml).

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm falcosecurity/event-generator run syscall --loop
```

The above command loops forever, incessantly generating a sample event each second. 


### Generate activity for the k8s audit rules
The `k8saudit` collection generates activity that matches the [k8s audit event ruleset](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/rules/k8s_audit_rules.yaml).


```shell
$ event-generator run k8saudit --loop --namespace `falco-eg-sandbox`
```
> N.B.: the namespace must exist already.

The above command loops forever, creating resources in the `falco-eg-sandbox` namespace and deleting the after each iteration.

**N.B.**
- the namespace must already exist
- to produce any effect the Kubernetes audit log must be enabled, see [here](https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/kubernetes-audit/)

## FAQ

### What sample events can be generated by this tool?
See the [events registry](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/tree/master/events).

### Can I contribute by adding new events?
Sure! 

Check out the [events registry](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/tree/master/events) conventions, then feel free to open a PR.
Your contribution is highly appreciated.

### Can I use this project as a library?
This project provides three main packages that can be imported and used separately:

- `/cmd` contains the CLI implementation
- `/events` contains the events registry
- `/pkg/runner` contains the actions runner implementations

Feel free to use them as you like on your projects.
