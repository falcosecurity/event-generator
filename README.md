**Warning** — We strongly recommend that you run the program within Docker (see below), since some commands might alter your system. 
    For example, some actions modify files and directories below /bin, /etc, /dev, etc.
    Make sure you fully understand what is the purpose of this tool before running any action.

## Usage

The full command line documentation is [here](./docs/event-generator.md).

### List actions

```shell
$ event-generator list

helper.ExecLs
helper.NetworkActivity
helper.RunShell
k8saudit.ClusterRoleWithPodExecCreated
k8saudit.ClusterRoleWithWildcardCreated
k8saudit.ClusterRoleWithWritePrivilegesCreated
k8saudit.CreateDisallowedPod
k8saudit.CreateHostNetworkPod
k8saudit.CreateModifyConfigmapWithPrivateCredentials
k8saudit.CreateNodePortService
k8saudit.CreatePrivilegedPod
k8saudit.CreateSensitiveMountPod
k8saudit.K8SConfigMapCreated
k8saudit.K8SDeploymentCreated
k8saudit.K8SServiceCreated
k8saudit.K8SServiceaccountCreated
syscall.ChangeThreadNamespace
syscall.CreateFilesBelowDev
syscall.DbProgramSpawnedProcess
syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs
syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs
syscall.NonSudoSetuid
syscall.ReadSensitiveFileTrustedAfterStartup

syscall.ScheduleCronJobs
syscall.SystemProcsNetworkActivity
syscall.SystemUserInteractive
syscall.UserMgmtBinaries
syscall.WriteBelowBinaryDir
syscall.WriteBelowEtc
syscall.WriteBelowRpmDatabase
```

### Run actions
```
event-generator run [regexp]
```
Without arguments, it runs all actions; otherwise, only those actions matching the given regular expression.

For example, to run `syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs` and
`syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs` actions only:
```shell
$ sudo event-generator run syscall\.\*BinaryDirs

INFO sleep for 1s                                  action=syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs
INFO writing to /bin/directory-created-by-event-generator  action=syscall.MkdirBinaryDirs
INFO sleep for 1s                                  action=syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs
INFO modifying /bin/true to /bin/true.event-generator and back  action=syscall.ModifyBinaryDirs
```

Useful options:
- `--loop` to run actions in a loop
- `--sleep` to set the length of time to wait before running an action (default to `1s`)

All other options are documented [here](./docs/event-generator_run.md).


#### With Docker

Run all events with the Docker image locally:

```shell
docker run -it --rm falcosecurity/event-generator run
```


#### With Kubernetes

Run the following command to create the Service Account (`falco-event-generator`), Cluster Role, and Role that will allow the tool to create objects in the current namespace:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment/role-rolebinding-serviceaccount.yaml
```

Run all events once using a Kubernetes job:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment/run-as-job.yaml
```

Run all events in a loop using a Kubernetes deployment:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment/event-generator.yaml
```

**N.B.**
The above commands apply to the `default` namespace. Use the `--namespace` option to use a different namespace. It will generate events in the same namespace.

## Collections

### Generate System Call activity
The `syscall` collection performs a variety of suspect actions detected by the [default Falco ruleset](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/rules/falco_rules.yaml).

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm falcosecurity/event-generator run syscall --loop
```

The above command loops forever, incessantly generating a sample event each second. 


### Generate activity for the k8s audit rules
The `k8saudit` collection generates activity that matches the [k8s audit event ruleset](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/rules/k8s_audit_rules.yaml).


```shell
$ event-generator run k8saudit --loop --namespace `falco-eg-sandbox`
```
> N.B.: the namespace must exist already.

The above command loops forever, creating resources in the `falco-eg-sandbox` namespace and deleting the after each iteration.

**N.B.**
- the namespace must already exist
- to produce any effect the Kubernetes audit log must be enabled, see [here](https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/kubernetes-audit/)


## Test rules

Since `v0.4.0`, this tool introduces a convenient integration test suite for Falco rules. The `event-generator test` command can run actions and test them against a running Falco instance.

> This feature requires Falco 0.24.0 or newer. Before using the command below, you need [Falco installed](https://falco.org/docs/installation/) and running with the [gRPC Output](https://falco.org/docs/grpc/) enabled.

#### Test locally (`syscall` only)

Run the following command to test `syscall` actions on a local Falco instance (connects via Unix socket to `/var/run/falco.sock` by default):

```shell
sudo ./event-generator test syscall
```

#### Test on Kubernetes

Then, run the following command to create the Service Account (`falco-event-generator`), Cluster Role, and Role that will allow the tool to create objects in the current namespace:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment/role-rolebinding-serviceaccount.yaml
```

Finally:

```shell
kubectl apply -f deployment/run-test.yaml
```

Note that to test `k8saudit` events, you need [Kubernetes audit log] enabled both in Kubernetes and Falco.

## Benchmark

Since `v0.5.0`, the `event-generator` can also be used for benchmarking a running instance of Falco. The command `event-generator bench` generates a high number of Event Per Second (EPS) to show you events throughput allowed by your Falco installation.

> This feature requires Falco 0.24.0 or newer. Before using the command in the section below, you need [Falco installed](https://falco.org/docs/installation/) and running with the [gRPC Output](https://falco.org/docs/grpc/) enabled.

Finally, be aware that Falco embeds a rate-limiter for notifications that affect the gRPC Outputs APIs too. You probably need to increase the `outputs.rate` and `outputs.max_burst` values [within the Falco configuration](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/e2bf87d207a32401da271835e15dadf957f68e8c/falco.yaml#L90-L104), otherwise EPS will be rate-limited by the throttling mechanism.

### Run a benchmark

Before starting a benchmark, the most important thing to understand is that the `--sleep` option controls the number of EPS (default to `250ms`): reducing this value will increase the EPS. Furthermore, if the `--loop` option is set, the sleeping duration is automatically halved on each round. The `--pid` option can be used to monitor the Falco process. 

> You can find more details about the command-line usage [here](docs/event-generator_bench.md).

Please, keep in mind that not all actions can be used for benchmarking since some of them take too long to generate a high number of EPS. For example, `k8saudit` actions are not supposed to work, since those actions need some time to create Kubernetes resources. Also, some `syscall` actions sleep for a while (like the [syscall.ReadSensitiveFileUntrusted](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/blob/7bf714aab8da5a3f6d930225f04852e97d682dac/events/syscall/read_sensitive_file_trusted_after_startup.go#L10)) thus cannot be used.

**Benchmark example**

Once you have relaxed the rate-limiter in the Falco configuration, for example by setting:

```yaml
outputs:
  rate: 1000000000
  max_burst: 1000000000
```

Then, a common way for benchmarking a local Falco instance is by running the following command (that connects via Unix socket to `/var/run/falco.sock` by default):

```shell
sudo event-generator bench "ChangeThreadNamespace|ReadSensitiveFileUntrusted|WriteBelowBinaryDir" --loop --pid $(ps -ef | awk '$8=="falco" {print $2}')
```

## FAQ

### What sample events can this tool generate?
See the [events registry](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/tree/master/events).

### Can I contribute by adding new events?
Sure! 

Check out the [events registry](https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator/tree/master/events) conventions, then feel free to open a P.R.

Your contribution is highly appreciated.

### Can I use this project as a library?
This project provides three main packages that can be imported and used separately:

- `/cmd` contains the CLI implementation
- `/events` contains the events registry
- `/pkg/runner` contains the actions runner implementations

Feel free to use them as you like on your projects.
